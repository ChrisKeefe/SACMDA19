	abstract = {Taxonomic classification of marker-gene DNA sequences is a key step in the analysis of microbial ecology data. Accurate species-level characterisation of microbial communities by sequencing standard marker-gene sequence fragments has proved elusive. We show that knowing a sample{\textquoteright}s Earth Microbiome Project Ontology (EMPO) habitat type always increases taxonomic classification accuracy, usually to the point where classification accuracy at species level exceeds the genus-level classification accuracy achieved with EMPO-ignorant methods. This improvement comes from setting EMPO habitat type-specific taxonomic class weights for a naive Bayes taxonomic classifier to the average microbial composition for that habitat. We provide q2-clawback, a QIIME 2 plugin for compiling taxonomic class weights from a given collection of samples or by directly downloading data from the Qiita microbial study management platform. The weights output by q2-clawback are compatible with the q2-feature-classifier taxonomic classifier. We show that taxonomic weights averaged across the EMPO 3 habitat types (representing the observed global frequencies of microbial taxa in the Earth Microbiome Project database) typically increase sequence classification accuracy, providing an avenue for improving classification of samples of unknown or uncharacterized sample types for which custom class weights cannot be assembled. q2-clawback also provides a utility for estimating how effectively a new set of taxonomic class weights will improve taxonomic classification accuracy. Apart from the important accuracy improvements in taxonomic classification, our results represent a meta-analysis of marker-gene amplicon sequence data across 7,204 studies to reveal useful patterns of taxonomic abundance.},

	abstract = {The central aims of many host or environmental microbiome studies are to elucidate factors associated with microbial community compositions and to relate microbial features to outcomes. However, these aims are often complicated by difficulties stemming from high-dimensionality, non-normality, sparsity, and the compositional nature of microbiome data sets. A key tool in microbiome analysis is beta diversity, defined by the distances between microbial samples. Many different distance metrics have been proposed, all with varying discriminatory power on data with differing characteristics. Here, we propose a compositional beta diversity metric rooted in a centered log-ratio transformation and matrix completion called robust Aitchison PCA. We demonstrate the benefits of compositional transformations upstream of beta diversity calculations through simulations. Additionally, we demonstrate improved effect size, classification accuracy, and robustness to sequencing depth over the current methods on several decreased sample subsets of real microbiome data sets. Finally, we highlight the ability of this new beta diversity metric to retain the feature loadings linked to sample ordinations revealing salient intercommunity niche feature importance.IMPORTANCE By accounting for the sparse compositional nature of microbiome data sets, robust Aitchison PCA can yield high discriminatory power and salient feature ranking between microbial niches.
